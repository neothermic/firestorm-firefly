Min requirements:
	

	Motors + Props
		See ScoutUAV website about motors and prop recommendations
	
	Battery
		LiPo - Do we have a target flight time? Most existing models average around 8-15 mins flight time

	Arduino!
		Nano to save weight? This drives the price up...
		If we are using our arduino as a flight controller, do we need an arduino MEGA as currently laser tag uses all the digital 			pins.

	Raspi!
		Again, model A is lighter but we probably need the specs of the model B

	IMU
		Inertial Measurement Unit - We have a few options here, we probably need 6 degrees of freedom - is it worthwhile going up to 			9? (Adding a magnetometer so we know which direction we're facing NSEW)
		Ardupilot is a bit of an all in one cheaty solution which includes the microcontroller (our arduino would not be used for 			flight control) but it might be a bit of a hollow victory. 
		Sparkfun's 9DOF sensor stick looks like a good candidate assuming we can make it work - do we buy the sparkfun board or 		attempt to make our own? Full schematics are available...

	Frame
		We could try to build this, but since it is likely to be a big cause of any instability or excess weight it might be an area 			to concede and just buy a prebuilt one.

	Wifi adapter
